Symmetric encryption is a cryptographic system for quickly encrypting, decrypting, or compressing data, and it is a class of extremely important basic cryptographic algorithms. 

I am currently a Researcher at the [College of Cyber Security, Jinan University](https://xxxy.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm), (Guangzhou, China). Our team is dedicated to the analysis and design of symmetric encryption, and we welcome researchers or students interested in this area to join our team.
